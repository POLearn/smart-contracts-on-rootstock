# Welcome to Rootstock Course

Rootstock (RSK) is a decentralized blockchain built on top of Bitcoin, enabling smart contract functionality while leveraging Bitcoin's security. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily focuses on peer-to-peer value transfer, Rootstock extends Bitcoinâ€™s capabilities by supporting general-purpose decentralized applications (DApps).

Rootstock is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning developers can create and deploy DApps using the Solidity programming language, just like on Ethereum. The global state of Rootstock includes not only account balances but also the state of each deployed smart contract.

The platform uses **RBTC** (Rootstock Bitcoin), a Bitcoin-backed token, for transaction fees and smart contract interactions. With Rootstock, developers can build decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, NFT platforms, and other DApps, combining Bitcoin's security with the flexibility of smart contracts.
