### What is Rootstock?

Rootstock (RSK) is a smart contract platform designed to enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, near-instant payments, and increased scalability. Built on top of Bitcoin, Rootstock leverages Bitcoin's security through a process known as merged mining. This means it uses Bitcoin's hashing power to secure its network, making it one of the most secure smart contract platforms available.

One of the standout features of Rootstock is its compatibility with Ethereum. This compatibility allows developers to utilize Ethereum's tools and libraries for smart contract development, making it easier for those familiar with Ethereum to transition to or integrate with Rootstock. By supporting Ethereum's virtual machine and RPC, Rootstock provides a seamless development experience for Ethereum developers.

Rootstock not only enhances security and functionality but also addresses scalability and payment speed. It offers near-instant payments, which is a significant improvement over traditional blockchain transaction times. This makes Rootstock an attractive option for developers looking to build scalable and efficient blockchain applications.
