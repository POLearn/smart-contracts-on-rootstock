# Rootstock Rune Bridge: Connecting Bitcoin and RSK

The **Rootstock Rune Bridge** is an exciting tool that connects Bitcoin’s blockchain to Rootstock, allowing users to transfer Runes—unique, tokenized assets—across both networks. This bridge unlocks a new level of interoperability, combining Bitcoin’s robust security with the programmability of Rootstock to create a seamless experience for users looking to access decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin.

The process begins with **etching Runes on Bitcoin**. This is where users can create Runes by simply filling out a form. Once the Rune is generated, a Rootstock signer authorizes the transaction, eliminating the need for the user to sign anything themselves. This makes the process simple and user-friendly, especially for beginners.

After the Rune is etched on Bitcoin, the **ERC1155 token representation** of the Rune is created on the Rootstock network. This is where the Rune gets its digital twin on Rootstock, carrying over all the details and attributes that the user provided during the creation process. The best part? The user receives an initial supply of these tokens, thanks to a "premine," allowing them to start using their Rune right away in various DeFi applications.

Once the Rune is tokenized on Rootstock, it can be **transferred, traded, or managed** freely. This opens up a wide array of possibilities for DeFi use cases, such as using Runes as collateral for loans, participating in liquidity pools, or simply trading them within the DeFi ecosystem.
